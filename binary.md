**Hold up ten fingers and ask "How many is this?"**<br>
Students should respond "ten".

** Give a writing instrument to a student and ask "can you write that for me?"**<br>
Student should write 10.

**Ask a student to write ten in a different way.**<br>
Students can write `||||||||||`, `2 x 5`, the word `TEN`, the roman numeral `X`, etc.

**When a student writes the word "ten", point to it and ask what words are made of.**<br>
Students should respond "letters".

**Ask how many letters are in the English alphabet.**<br>
Students should respond "26".

**Point to a written number and ask how many "letters" are used to represent numbers.**<br>
Students should respond "10".

**What are the ten "numerals" used to represent numbers?**<br>
Students should respond 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**How many numbers can you make out of these numerals?**<br>
Students should eventually respond "infinity".

**Why do we have ten numerals?**<br>
It might be because we have 10 fingers and toes.

**What if we were aliens with only two fingers, how many numerals might we have?**<br>
Students should respond 2.

**How many numbers can you make with only two numerals?**<br>
Students often start by responding "not as many", or thinking there is a limitation.

**Okay, let's start counting with only two numerals. For simplicity, lets assume they are 0 and 1. What are the first two numbers we can write?**<br>
First write 0 (to represent the number 0), then write 1.

**How can we represent two?**<br>
Student should come up with "10". Some guiding questions are<br>
- **What do we do in the normal counting system when we run out of numerals at 9?**
- **What does it mean to "carry"?**

**If someone read the "10", they may assume you mean the number ten. In this number system, it means two. How can we differentiate between the two?**<br>
Students should come up with a subscript notation (superscript may be confused with exponentation), so $10_2$ means "10" in base 2.

**How do we continue making larger numbers, where each number has a unique representation?**<br>
Start counting up in binary (`11`, `100`, `101`, ...), not necessarily in order.

**In our base 10 counting system, what do you call the columns that numerals are in?**<br>
The ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on.

**Why are they called the ones, tens, and hundreds place?**<br>
Each column refers to the number of "ones", "tens", "hundreds", etc. Each column refers to the number of powers of 10.

**When we start the second column in our binary number system, what should we call it?**<br>
The two's column.

**What is the first number that requires the two's column?**<br>
The number 2.

**What is the only other two digit number that can be written in binary? What number does it represent?**<br>
The digit `11`, which represents the number 3.

**How do we represent the number 4?**<br>
Start another column.

**What should we call this column?**<br>
The four's column.

**How do we add one to a binary number?**<br>
If the right digit is 0, add 1 to it. If it is 1, then carry to the left. It may help to pad numbers with 0's to make this more apparent.

**Let's keep adding one to this binary number. Can anyone tell me the next number?**<br>
Students should keep practicing the increment of a binary number until it is intuitive.

**How many numbers do you think we can write if we keep going?**<br>
Infinite numbers!

**Let's look at something else. How do you add and multiply numbers in base 10? Can you use the same process to add and multiply in base 2?**<br>
Students should perform the same mathematical operations with base 2 numbers, and see how the processes are the same and they produce correct answers in each respective base.

**Which is easier, base 2 or base 10 arithmetic?**<br>
Students present their opinions on which is easier.

**What is a real-world situation where you only need two numerals to represent a value?**<br>
Drive the conversation toward light switches and on/off toggles.

**What number represents off, and which represents on?**<br>
0 represents off, and 1 represents on.

**Does anyone know what a transistor is?**<br>
Transistors are on and off switches that are the building blocks of digital circuits.

**If computers are built with on/off switches, what base would be most convenient to represent numbers in?**<br>
In base 2, because an off switch can represent 0, and an on switch can represent 1.
