#### Base 2

> Hold up two fingers.

**What if we were aliens with only two fingers, how many symbols might we have?**<br>
Perhaps we would only have two.

**How many numbers can you represent with only two symbols?**<br>
You can still make infinite numbers.

> Pick up a writing utensil like a pen or whiteboard marker.

**Let's start counting with only two symbols. For simplicity, lets assume they are 0 and 1. What are the first two numbers we can write?**<br>
First write 0 (to represent the number 0), then write 1.

**How can we represent two?**<br>
Student should come up with "10". Some guiding questions are<br>
- **What do we do in the normal counting system when we run out of numerals at 9?**
- **What does it mean to "carry"?**

**If someone read the "10", they may assume you mean the number ten. In this number system, it means two. How can we differentiate between the two?**<br>
Students should come up with a subscript notation (superscript may be confused with exponentation), so $10_2$ means "10" in base 2.

> Keep counting up in base 2 to reinforce the idea of incrementing and carrying with a binary number.
