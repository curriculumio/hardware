**What if we wanted to represent another set of characters, like the letters, with our smaller alphabet of only two symbols?**<br>
We could have 0 represent "a", 1 represent "b", 10 represent "c", 11 represent "d", and so on.

> Write the binary digit 1001.

**Should we interpret that as c-a-b, or b-a-a-b?**<br>
We should make each letter a certain length of binary digits, and pad empty space with zeros.

> Show students an ASCII table.

**Here is a table of all letters and punctuation characters with their corresponding numbers. This is the standard table used by all computers to represent letters. Why should every computer use the same numbers to represent letters?**
Because if there were two standards, computers on one standard would not be able to communicate with computers on the other standard. It would be like two people who don't speak the same language.
