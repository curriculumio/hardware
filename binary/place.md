> Underline each digit in a base 10 number that has multiple digits.

**In our base 10 counting system, what do you call the positions that symbols are in?**<br>
The ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on.

**Why are they called the ones, tens, and hundreds place?**<br>
Each column refers to the number of "ones", "tens", "hundreds", etc.

**What is the relation between the column's position and its place?**<br>
Each column's is scaled by a successive power of 10.

> Write the binary digit "1".

**When we start the second column in our binary number system, what should we call it?**<br>
The two's column.

**What is the first number that requires the two's column?**<br>
The number 2.

**What is the only other two digit number that can be written in binary? What number does it represent?**<br>
The digit `11`, which represents the number 3.

**How do we represent the number 4?**<br>
Start another column.

**What should we call this column?**<br>
The four's column.

**How do we add one to a binary number?**<br>
If the right digit is 0, add 1 to it. If it is 1, then carry to the left. It may help to pad numbers with 0's to make this more apparent.

> Keep incrementing a binary number, writing the sequence of binary numbers along the way.

**If I wrote a random binary number on the board, could you tell me the number it represents?**
Students should apply the same idea of bases representing powers of 2. They can then add the powers together, and the sum is the base 10 value.
