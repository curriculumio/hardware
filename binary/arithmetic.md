**How do you add and multiply numbers in base 10? Can you use the same process to add and multiply in base 2?**<br>
Yes you can!


> Students should perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with base 2 numbers, and see how the processes are the same and produce correct answers in each respective base.

**Which is easier, base 2 or base 10 arithmetic?**<br>
Students present their opinions on which is easier.

**What is a real-world situation where you only need two numerals to represent a value?**<br>
Drive the conversation toward light switches and on/off toggles.

**What number represents off, and which represents on?**<br>
0 represents off, and 1 represents on.

**Does anyone know what a transistor is?**<br>
Transistors are on and off switches that are the building blocks of digital circuits.

**If computers are built with on/off switches, what base would be most convenient to represent numbers in?**<br>
In base 2, because an off switch can represent 0, and an on switch can represent 1.
