**What are words made of?**<br>
Students respond "letters".

**How many letters are in the English alphabet?**<br>
Students respond "26".

> Point to a number.

**How many 'letters' are used to represent numbers?**<br>
Students should respond "10". Emphasize *letters* so students see the connection between letters and digits as sets of symbols.

**What are the ten symbols used to represent numbers?**<br>
Students should respond 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**How many numbers can you create using these symbols?**<br>
Students respond "infinite".

**Why do we have ten symbols? Why not seven, or twelve, or fifty?**<br>
It might be because we have 10 fingers and toes. This question is designed to get students to question the fundamental notion of using base 10, which is most likely the only base they have ever been exposed to.
